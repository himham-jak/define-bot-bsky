# define-bot-bsky
A bot meant to be knowledgable and useful with knowledge from various dictionaries.

- This is my first attempt at a Bluesky bot and meant to be instructive to myself and others.

- I'll begin by installing the [Skyware/bot](https://github.com/skyware-js/bot) package with `npm install @skyware/bot`.

- Since the bot's login details are stored in the env per the [Documentation](https://skyware.js.org/guides/bot/introduction/getting-started/), we'll need to [.gitignore](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/how-to-create-gitignore-file/) them.
